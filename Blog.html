	<h1> Holding Myself Accountable - A Desperate Sinner </h1>

	<h2> Day 1 (16/07/20) </h2>

		<h3> Parents </h3>

			<p>Today, I had the longest video call ever with my parents. It lasted for an hour. It was enjoyable and fun and I opened up to them about my struggles as a Christian: I was really struggling theologically as I question things, etc. I didn't tell them specificallly of <b>that</b> issue but I told them of how I have lost the passion I had prior with The Word.

			<br>

			I actually had a nightmare today. An old grandma who cant say anything and is immobile. I woke up crying thinking of my parents and missing them. But I realized then that I was really being horizontal. Why do I not cry when I am away from the Scriptures?

		<h3> The other day: A discussion on Ontology with Bryan </h3>

			<p> It was frustrating. I never really liked the way Bryan speaks -- not him, but his mannerism. 
				<br>
				Honestly, it was tough. He pointed out that I really am not that good of a reader: the way I read has always been with the purpose of finding something to interest, excite, or blow my mind. I never considered how they are to change my values, worldview, etc. This would influence my reading the bible as well! The bible is full of narratives, and it a <b> writing, a book, a scripture </b>. Jon Kho had pointed this out to me as well prior. This would actually explain why I feel distant and not so rebuked by The Word. I know theoretically that it is <b> reality </b> but I think I separate myself from it, seeing it as less of something which has to shape me.. I need to read the Scriptures with God in mind. 

				<br>

		<h3> So Where Am I Now? </h3>

			<p> Honestly, not great still. I still have questions, doubts.. but I want to re-evangelize myself. I am re-reading Matthew right now. I pray that God may open my hardened heart and my eyes to see. Thank you, Lord </p>

	<h2> Day 3  (22/07/20) </h2>

		<h3> Numb </h3>

			That's right. I'm starting to feel nummb again. I feel distant. I don't know anymore.
			I submitted my reflections to some people today:
